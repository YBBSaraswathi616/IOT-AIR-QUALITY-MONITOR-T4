Description:
This project simulates a smart light system using an Arduino Uno and the Serial Monitor in Tinkercad Circuits. The light (represented by an LED) can be turned ON or OFF by sending simple serial commands (1 or 0). This mimics the functionality of controlling a smart appliance using a mobile app or Bluetooth, but without requiring any physical hardware.

Itâ€™s an ideal introductory IoT (Internet of Things) project that teaches the basics of serial communication and device automation.

Benefits:
Easy to simulate and understand
No hardware required
Great introduction to IoT concepts

How It Works:
The user starts the simulation and opens the Serial Monitor.
Sending the value "1" turns the LED ON.
Sending the value "0" turns the LED OFF.
The Serial Monitor simulates a mobile app sending commands via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
